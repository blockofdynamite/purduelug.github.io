Now that school has started once again, PLUG is gearing up for an active
semester filled with exciting activities. Â If you'd like to be involved
in planning out this semester, I will be holding an office hour in the
PLUG office (LWSN B128) on Thursdays from 6-7pm. I hope that the office
hour can eventually evolve into a regular meeting time if possible.

Our callout will be on **Thurs, Sept. 10** at **7pm** in **BRNG 1230**.
Free pizza and drinks!
