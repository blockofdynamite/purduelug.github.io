The second session of Linux 201 will be Monday, February 13th at 7pm in
LWSN B158. Come learn about Python! We will cover semantics for anyone
who is new to the language, but otherwise we'll go strait into
applications of the language.

Older session material can be found in the wiki tab above in the Linux
X01 section. Topics include: intro to Linux, bash scripting, perl,
python, vim, backups, and more!
