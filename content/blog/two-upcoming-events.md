Description:  
Let's get you familiar with the required steps getting a basic  
version of GNU/Linux running on a desktop or laptop with every stage  
explained and demonstrated along the way!

Our goal is to get you familiar with the different pieces required to  
put together a working Arch Linux desktop starting with setting up the  
hard-drive up to installing a web browser.
