So, WordPress got hacked (what our site is running on).

I believe I have fixed everything, but if you notice something amiss, or
broken, please let me (Jeff) know. (Yes, the calendar on the right is
broken. Click "Calendar" in the top bar.)

Thanks, and see you at the next event!

Update 01/21/2017: We have finally got our site and DNS fully migrated
to new hosts that are more reliable (self-hosted webserver and
CloudFlare DNS). There are 404s across the site, and we are working to
fix it.~~

Everything is well and good.
