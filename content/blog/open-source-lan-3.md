The Open Source LAN is this Friday at 7pm in LWSN B134. Bring your
laptop or desktop. It doesn't matter if you're running Windows, Linux,
or Mac. We will be playing open source games like Alien Arena, 0AD (if
it works), Armagetron, Nethack, WarSow, Super Tux Kart, and more! Please
install these games in advance. If you need help, stop by the PLUG
office (LWSN B128) at 6pm and we'll try to help you get them up and
running.
