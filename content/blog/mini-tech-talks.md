Feel free to come join us for a mini Tech Talk coming up on Saturday,
February 15th from 2pm-4pm in Lilly 1105. Students will come up to talk
on a variety of topics. Afterwards, we'll go somewhere to get something
to eat (we'll decide as a group after the talk). The Tech talks will be
limited to about 15min each. We currently have four people scheduled to
talk. Please see the flier for details on the topics.
