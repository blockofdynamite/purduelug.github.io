We hope your finals go well!

Kick back and take a break from your exams by coming to PLUG Tea Time

3pm in the MSEE Atrium!

This event will help you relax during exam week and serves as a farewell
for PLUG's graduating officers.  Bring a coffee mug and, optionally, tea
you'd like others to try.  Tea and hot water will be provided.
