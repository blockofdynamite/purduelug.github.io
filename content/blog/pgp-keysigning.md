There will be a PGP signing event this coming Monday, October 21st at
6pm-7pm in LWSN B155. Please bring a student ID and government ID. Also,
please try to print about 10-30 copies of your pgp fingerprint
beforehand. Professor Gene Spafford has agreed to present on how PGP
works at the event.

You can generate a pgp key by doing the following:  
gpg --gen-key  
You can get the fingerprint for the key by doing the following:  
gpg --fingerprint &lt;keyId&gt;
