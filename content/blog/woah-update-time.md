Well, I've not been keeping up, have I? Sorry about that. So, here's a
massive update for you.

Our library is now massive! Ok, so it's not huge, but we probably have a
book on most technical topics you could ask for. And a binder of printed
man pages. Yup. Anyway, our estimation is around 240 books and magazines
and stuff, but we haven't actually counted them yet. If you want to come
down and browse the currently unorganized collection, you're welcome to!

We have decided on our office hours as well. You can see them on the
google calendar, but basically, they're 10:30-11:30 on Tuesday,
4:30-5:30 on Wednesday, some unknown time on Thursday, or by
appointment. We'll be happy to help you out, or just hang out! We do get
bored, after all...

We also have our general member meetings every two weeks in some room in
Beering. Again, it's on the calendar. Last week there were 4 of us,
total, so please, come down and help us be awesome! Last week we did
some awesome vim stuff, and Casey posted his rc files for us. You can
check them out on his github page: <https://github.com/thekcd/vimfiles>.
He has a pretty awesome set of vim files, but I personally prefer my own
screen file ;). I'll upload my own set of rc's in a few weeks. I doubt
Quinn will upload any, though...

Finally, I'm adding on the meeting minutes for the 11th and the 18th.
I'll add on the rest of them as I get them, but if you want them sooner,
you can just ask us at the office and we can find them for you.

(Also, feel free to email me and yell at me if I haven't posted an
update for a while, I need to keep up with this!)
