A cerner linux administrator is coming to Purdue to talk about the
backend for cerner's systems. He's gonna be in LWSN 155, and chances are
good (but not 100%) that pizza will be served.

Come on by on Thursday (September 30th) at 7 PM! We'd love to see ya'll
come! ...also, remind me never to put that sort of accent in a post.
