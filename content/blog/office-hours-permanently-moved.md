I hope you guys all had a fun spring break and are enjoying being back
at Purdue. Starting this week, I'm moving my office hours from 6-7pm to
4:20-5:20pm. This ends up working better with my schedule and I think
it'll work better for you guys as well so you don't have to come back to
campus late in the evening. You can come in whenever during office hours
to chat, get help with linux or free software, or check out one of our
many cool books. Hope to see you guys there.

Office Hours: Thursdays 4:20-5:20pm LWSN B128
