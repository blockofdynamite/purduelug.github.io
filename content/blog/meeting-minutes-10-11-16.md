I've decided to switch my dating system to a more easily searchable
format. YY-MM-DD. No guarantee I'll stick with it, though. Not much
happened because we didn't have an actual agenda available, so it was
all meeting addendum. It eventually decayed in us trying to find the
worst possible simulators from the ubuntu repositories.

Also, a gentle reminder about the member's meeting tonight at 6 in LWSN
1106. I'll be there and will give a brief overview of what's been going
on and what is going to happen. Most events are now being post-poned
until or planned for next semester, due to the time in the season and
time until Finals.
