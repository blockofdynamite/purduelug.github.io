Hello, ladies and gentlemen of the Open Source Movement! Also, hi to you
guys that just like linux. Hahaha, just kidding, everyone's cool around
here. Many of you know that we have an IRC channel on freenode. Many of
you probably have no idea what IRC is, let alone freenode. For those of
you who don't have any idea what IRC is, or don't know how it works, or
something, we have a web chat now that connects to the IRC channel!
Check it out [here](/getting-help.html)

Oh yeah, and come to our callout. Please?
