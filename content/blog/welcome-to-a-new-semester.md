Welcome freshmen, returning students, and everyone else to Fall 2013.
The callout has been scheduled, you can see it on our calendar. BoilerBuntu will be making its first release this semester at
the Boilermaker GetInvolved fair. You can see what we currently have on
github at www.github.com/purduelug/boilerbuntu. If you have questions,
send an email out on the google groups mailing list. I hope you have a
wonderful semester!
