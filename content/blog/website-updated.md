Hey guys! I'm your new Vice President! Apparently this job includes
website development. If you can't tell, I've made a few major changes to
the website, the most noticable is probably the theme. I've also
upgraded wordpress to the latest version, activated akismet (spam
filter), and added a few plugins and widgets and whatnot. I plan to keep
this site a little bit more up-to-date then it has been in the
past...and we're going to start that by having our weekly meeting
minutes posted. That'll happen as soon as I get the weekly minutes. And
decide how to upload them. If you don't like this new theme, or have
anything you want to modify with the site, comment here or shoot me an
email, or come by my office hour.
