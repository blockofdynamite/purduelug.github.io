Thank you to everyone who attended session 1 and session 2.Â  Linux 101
Session 3 is coming up THIS **Monday, October 17th at 7pm in LWSN
B158**. We'll be talking about Managing Jobs, Backing up files, and
Scheduling tasks on your Linux system. Anyone is welcome to attend! If
you have laptops you may wish to bring them, but computer use will be
provided. Most commands for this session will not require super user
permissions.

The sessions are designed to accommodate those who are new or have had
minimal-medium experience with Linux. For reference to our old sessions,
click the "wiki" tab above and follow through to Linux 101, where you
can find all the information for past sessions. There is also an "Event
Video" tab where you can watch the first session!

Have a good week!
