There is a member meeting this week. James Miller will be coming to give
another talk about installing Arch from scratch. If you missed this the
first time or you'd like to go through it again, this is a great
opportunity to get a deeper understanding of the Linux installation
process and learn how to install Arch Linux!

What: Arch Linux from Scratch  
Where: LWSN B148  
When: Tuesday, March 26th from 6-9pm
