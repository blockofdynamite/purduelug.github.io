Our tour of the RCAC data center is tentatively scheduled for
**Thursday, Sept. 24th** at **6pm**. Meet at the PLUG office (**LWSN
B128**) at 6pm sharp so we can walk over to the MATH building.

Also, I've recreated the PLUG calendar so I now can add events to it. If
you have the old google calendar, unsubscribe from the old one first,
then add the new one (otherwise you might get duplicate calendars.) The
link to it can be found
[here](http://www.google.com/calendar/embed?src=dqiogks1d875qpvduablo7j52c%40group.calendar.google.com&ctz=America/New_York)
and in the sidebar.
