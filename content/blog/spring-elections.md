It's that time again where we need to elect a new president and
treasurer. If you are at all interested in being a contributor to PLUG,
you should really consider attending, either to vote or to be
Pres/VP/Tresurer. Right now I'm pretty sure both spots are wide open at
this point, so come out and make a difference for PLUG. The elections
will be held this Thursday (4/22) at 6pm in LWSN B128. Hope to see you
there!
