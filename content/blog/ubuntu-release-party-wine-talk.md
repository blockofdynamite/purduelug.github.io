**Ubuntu Release Party / WINE Talk  
Tuesday Oct 18th @ 6pm - 8pm  
BRNG B248**

To make this more fun; if you are attending please bring some food to
share!

Ubuntu has been release and now it is time to have a party! For this get
together we will have food (provided by yourself and your peers),
install media / support, and a talk about some of the new changes in
Ubuntu.  
But wait there is more!

Don’t want to leave Windows because you have programs you can’t get on
Linux? For the second half of our get together member Lucas Pearson will
be giving a talk / demo on WINE, which allows you to run windows
programs on Linux. WINE supports an ample amount of programs, and the
list expands every day! We will also be providing a list of alternative
Linux applications for those applications you love on Windows.

Make sure to come join the party and check this one out!
