Welcome to the brand-spanking-new Purdue Linux Users Group website!Â 
After many months of stagnation, the webmaster finally got tired of
being lazy and got around to

1.  Getting an account with CSociety for hosting our site,
2.  Pointing our domain name at the new address, and
3.  Getting Wordpress installed.

Now all that remains is to get MediaWiki installed and the old data
pulled off our broken old malfunctioning servers.
