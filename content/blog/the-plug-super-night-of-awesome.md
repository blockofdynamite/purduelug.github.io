You’re invited to what is going to be the most awesome night in LWSN
ever! That’s right! The PLUG SUPER NIGHT OF AWESOME! You may say to
yourself, what could be so awesome that you typed the title in all caps?
Well how about a fresh and controversial tech talk about DNS, DNSsec,
and how it stopped SOPA? Did I mention it will be sponsored by OpenDNS
so there will be **free pizza, drinks, and OpenDNS swag!?!**

But that is only the half of it. Part 2 of the super night of awesome
will be PLUG’s Open Source LAN Party! Over 26 completely free and cross
platform (Windows, Mac, and Linux) games will be available for you to
download, install and get your pwn on with! Game types including first
person shooters, rts, tron style, sims, racing, and more! We will be
setting up tournaments to see who the top gamers in LWSN are!

PLUG’s Super Night of Awesome will be March 30^th^, with the talk
starting at 6:30 and the LAN following. It will be in LWSN B155. Make
sure to come to this epic night!
