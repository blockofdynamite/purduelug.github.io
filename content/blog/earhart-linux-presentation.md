PLUG is giving a presentation about Linux/open source software at
Earhart this week.

When: Tuesday, February 10th @ 8:15pm  
Where: Earhart Residence Hall, East Rec Lounge

This presentation is done per the request of one of the RAs at Earhart.
This will be a good presentation for people new to Linux, as it will be
a general overview of what Linux and open source software are. We will
give a brief history and overview, some demonstrations and then open it
up for questions.

Hope to see a lot of you there.
