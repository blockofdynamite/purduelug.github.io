Google is hosting a tech talk on **Thursday,** **Sept. 24th** at **6pm**
in **ARMS 1010** so I have moved the data center tour to the following
week. I encourage everyone to check it out because Google is an awesome
company and they'll have free food and swag :)

Our tour of the RCAC data center is officially scheduled for **Thursday,
Oct. 1st** at **6pm**. Meet at the PLUG office (**LWSN B128**) at 6pm
sharp so we can walk over to the MATH building.

Also, [here](http://rohitj.net/files/introtoopensource.pdf) are the
slides from the Intro to Open Source presentation.
