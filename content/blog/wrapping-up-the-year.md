Hello Pluggers!

First let me say thanks to everyone who came to the PLUG Super Night of
Awesome. The tech talk went really well, the pizza was delicious (as
always), and the LAN was tons of fun and pwnage. We gave away stickers,
t-shirts, and some awesome toys. Make sure to check out the images from
the event

Since we are toward the end of the year, it is time for me to wrap up at
PLUG president and pass the torch. I will not be back up for election
since I am graduating from Purdue at the end of this semester. I have
had a great time as the president of PLUG. I think we had some good
opportunities to do some really fun events over the years that I have
been involved, and I hoped you guys enjoyed it as much as I did. However
none of this would have been possible if it wasn’t for the work of all
the PLUG officers and our advisor, especially Thor Smith and Spencer
Julian. So a big thanks to them, and a big thanks  to all of the
Pluggers who have been involved and making this so much fun. :)

That said, we need to find new officers for next year! I believe that
Thor and Spencer plan on still staying involved, but we need all the
help we can get! If you are interested in helping with anything or
becoming an officer, please contact me at qdamerel (at) purdue (dot)
edu. The current positions we would like to fill are: Treasure, Web
Master, and Secretary; as well as anyone is free to run for President or
Vice-President. Once everyone who wants to be considered contacts me, we
will be having an official vote for the positions. I will post when /
where when we plan that. J

Again, thanks everyone for the fun times :)

Sincerely,  
Quinn Damerell – PLUG President 2011-2012.
