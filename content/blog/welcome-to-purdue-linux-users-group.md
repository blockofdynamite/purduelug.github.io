Hello everyone old and new!! Purdue Linux Users Group (PLUG) is a
computer organization here at Purdue that advocates and supports the use
and development of Linux and Open Source Software. This means we help
with questions, help people install Linux, talk about / develop Android,
and help anyone with general computer needs. The best thing about our
group is we are open to not only CS majors, but everyone here at Purdue!

We are a very open group, and are open to suggestions of any kind. If
you want to start a team to begin developing an Open Source Kinect App,
let us know. If you have an event or talk in mind that you think would
be cool, let us know. If you have some open source software that you are
interested in or would like to know more about, let us know.

**<span style="color: #333333;">We are an extremely awesome group, and
above is only a subset of what we do. To get the full story, come to our
call-out or get involved in one of the following ways:</span>**
