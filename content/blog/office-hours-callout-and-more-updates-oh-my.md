Hey! We now officially have office hours! You can see them to the right,
there. Also, our callout is coming up! It's gonna be the 8th of
September from 7-8 in Lawson 1106. You should come check it out. We'll
have free pizza! And who doesn't like free pizza, right?

Also, I've made a couple more updates to the website. Most notably, I
added a mobile version of our website, which you can get to by scanning
the 2D barcode to the right with your Android phone, or by going to
purduelug.org. Awesome stuff, no? I've also added a google sitemap and
some google analytics. If they're really interesting I'll keep you up to
date. If not, I won't. That simple.

I'll do my best to keep this updated throughout the year, but hopefully
our President and Treasurer will do some posting as well! Have a good
semester, and come check us out!
