I wonder how many people are actually reading this blog. Either way,
there's a new Open Source Repository up on campus!

Hosted by the IEEE CSociety (<http://csociety.org>) and maintained by me
for PLUG, the new Open Source Repository is available at
<http://csociety-ftp.csociety.org>. Right now we are only mirroring the
Ubuntu releases, but we can mirror more than that. I'm not exactly sure
what to add though, so throw some ideas at me!
