Thank you to everyone who attended and helped set up Linux 101! We
filled LWSN B158 and we had to get extra chairs! There were some
technical difficulties at the beginning of the presentation, but as a
whole the session was a success. After the session ended, the Vice
President Spencer Julian and Treasurer Thor Smith hung around to answer
questions and help install Linux, but they weren't the only ones helping
out. The next session will be held on October 3rd @7-8pm in LWSN B158.
It will cover package managers (installation of packages using binaries
graphically and through the command line) as well as installation of
packages from source. It will also cover file systems on Linux as well
as the Linux directory structure. I hope to see many of you there!
