Thank you to everyone who attended Linux 101 session 3. The resources
for Linux 101 may be found [here](/wiki/Linux_101_Home). The presentation
for session 3 is up. I will try to add more resources for this session
later during the week. The next session will be on Oct. 31st at 7pm in
LWSN B158, and it will cover bash scripting and configuration files.
